## Introduction
Web server using a Raspberry Pi and DHT22 sensor to graph the humidity and temperature in my apartment over time. The data can be accessed over a web browser.

## Setup

I use Python to access a DHT22 sensor to grab the temperature and humidity data. I also use a web server using Flask, uWSGI, SQLite, and JavaScript/jQuery.

Charts are made with Google Charts and Plotly for more advanced processing.
